So here I am. Final project at Flatiron School. Let me tell you, the last month has been a hell of a journey for me and my family. So much so that its 2 hours from my project review and 1) I'm still not finished and 2) I have 2 blogs to write before I graduate officially even if I pass today. But damn it, I'm gonna do it.

During the next to last week of online classes, me and my wife recieved some devestating news, and that news has been our new reality and top priority for the better part of the last month or so. And it has loomed large over this project every single minute of every single day. You see my wife, who is also a Flatiron student, was recently diagnosed with later stage breast cancer, and it's been a whirlwind of Dr appointments, insurance issues, and high level stress management ever since.

BUT, all you can do is power right on through things no matter how hard you get slapped in the face. And thats what this final project is to me. It's probably my least favorite, least inspried project to date, but it is a project built in a severe set of circumstances nonetheless, and for that I am extremely proud of what I have accomplished. Especially considering how the last month has played out.

I basically rushed through the online portion of React/Redux after getting the news. Not wanting to stress out over school while not being there for my wife. But, as I later learned it wasnt really buying time. Once I began my project I realized that I didnt really commit any of that section to memory, and during the ensuing 2 weeks, had to find 10 minutes at a time to actually learn the basic concepts of even starting a react project. about a week of this, and I had to turn to my cohort, and I leaned heavily on them to help fill in the gaps in my knowledge. I honestly wouldn't have even had a project to present if not for all of them coming together to help coach me along through my time of need. It's funny how in moments of crisis, its the people with little to no role in your regular life that are the ones in positions to help you the most. 

Even with there help, there was one critical component I was missing: time. I basically presented my final project with 4 somewhat solid days...days that really any little error would send me over the hill bananas because I didn't have the emotional stamina to deal with any kind of hindrance.

This post may be more of a venting than a techincal examination of my project, but you know what? Fuck it. Hell, while I'm writing this blog, my wife is actually in the hospital, and I had to leave her to finish my (hopefully last taks) and these 2 blog posts to graduate today. I mean, it has been one big slap after another. And life still isn't going to stop us!

Our healing journey has really just begun, but so has my coding journey! Win lose or draw on this project review, I've already witnessed the massive amount of growth in my ability to command React in just the last week or so.
