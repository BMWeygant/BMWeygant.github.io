<p>My name is Brandon, I recently left a job I was employed at for 15 years. For about 8 of those years I was a Union Rep for 600+ people, and I learned all sorts of valuable life lessons from it. But it was time to move on as I've felt stuck and not being able to personally grow, I stayed there about 5 years too long for my families sake. Now, I am here to challenge myself in ways I haven't been able to in quite a long time and am excited to see how it all turns out. </p>
